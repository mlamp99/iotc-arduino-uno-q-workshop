# LED Matrix Painter

The **LED Matrix Painter** example provides a web-based interface to draw, animate, and control the built-in LED Matrix of the Arduino UNO Q in real-time. It features a pixel editor with 3-bit (0-7) brightness control, database storage for your designs, and a code generator to export your frames as ready-to-use C++ code.

## Description

This App allows you to design visuals for the 8x13 LED matrix directly from your browser. It uses the `web_ui` Brick to host a graphical editor where you can paint individual pixels, adjust their brightness, and apply transformations like flipping or rotating. Every change you make in the browser is immediately reflected on the physical board.

The application uses the `dbstorage_sqlstore` Brick to automatically save your work in a local database. You can create multiple frames, organize them into animations, and use the "Code panel" to see the generated C++ code in real-time.

Key features include:
- **Real-time Control:** Drawing on the web grid updates the UNO Q matrix instantly.
- **Grayscale Control:** 8 brightness presets (0-7) for intuitive pixel control; this example configures the board for 3-bit grayscale (0–7).
- **Persistent Storage:** Frames are automatically saved to a database, allowing you to build complex animations over time.
- **Transformation Tools:** Invert, rotate, or flip designs with a single click.
- **Animation Mode:** Sequence frames to create animations and preview them on the board.
- **Code Export:** Generate `uint32_t` arrays compatible with the `Arduino_LED_Matrix` library for use in standalone sketches.

## Bricks Used

The LED Matrix Painter example uses the following Bricks:

- `web_ui`: Brick to create the interactive grid editor and manage API endpoints.
- `dbstorage_sqlstore`: Brick to persist frames and animation sequences using a SQLite database.

## How it Works

The LED Matrix Painter relies on a synchronized data flow between the browser, the Python backend, and the hardware.

**High-level data flow:**

```
Web Browser  ──►  HTTP API  ──►  Python Backend  ──►  Router Bridge  ──►  Arduino Sketch
                                       │                                        │
                                       ▼                                        ▼
                                SQLite Database                          LED Matrix Display
```

1.  **Web Interface**: The `app.js` script captures clicks on the grid. It debounces these events and sends the pixel data to the backend via the `/persist_frame` endpoint.
2.  **Python Backend**:
    *   **Data Model**: The `AppFrame` class normalizes the data, converting between frontend JSON, database records, and hardware byte arrays.
    *   **Persistence**: The `store.py` module uses `SQLStore` to save the frame data to a `frames` table in a SQLite database.
    *   **Bridge**: The `main.py` script sends the raw byte array to the board via `Bridge.call("draw", frame_bytes)`.
3.  **Arduino Sketch**: The sketch receives the raw byte data and uses the `Arduino_LED_Matrix` library to render the grayscale image.

## Understanding the Code

### 🔧 Backend (`main.py`, `store.py` & `app_frame.py`)

The Python backend manages the application logic, database, and hardware communication.

- **Data Model (`app_frame.py`)**: The `AppFrame` class is the core data structure that acts as a bridge between the different components. It extends the base `Frame` class to add application-specific metadata like `id`, `name`, `position`, and `duration`. It handles three distinct data contracts:
  - **API Contract**: `to_json()` / `from_json()` formats data for the web frontend.
  - **Database Contract**: `to_record()` / `from_record()` formats data for `SQLStore` storage.
  - **Hardware Contract**: `to_board_bytes()` packs pixels into the specific byte format expected by the Arduino sketch.

```python
class AppFrame(Frame):
    def to_record(self) -> dict:
        """Convert to a database record dict for storage."""
        return {
            "id": self.id,
            "name": self.name,
            "rows": json.dumps(self.arr.tolist()), # Serialize pixels to JSON string
            "brightness_levels": int(self.brightness_levels),
            # ...
        }
```

- **Initialization**:
  - `designer = FrameDesigner()`: Initializes the frame designer utility from `arduino.app_utils`, which provides the logic for transformation operations (invert, rotate, flip).
  - `store.init_db()`: Creates the SQLite database and tables for storing frames if they don't exist.

- **API Endpoints**: The backend exposes several HTTP endpoints using `ui.expose_api` to handle frontend requests:
  - `POST /persist_frame`: Saves or updates frames in the database and updates the board.
  - `POST /load_frame`: Loads a specific frame by ID or retrieves the last edited frame.
  - `GET /list_frames`: Returns all saved frames to populate the bottom panel.
  - `POST /play_animation`: Sends a sequence of frames to the Arduino to play as an animation.
  - `POST /transform_frame`: Applies geometric transformations to the pixel data.
  - `POST /export_frames`: Generates the C++ header file content.

- **Hardware Update**: The `apply_frame_to_board` function sends the visual data to the microcontroller via the Bridge.

```python
# main.py
def apply_frame_to_board(frame: AppFrame):
    """Send frame bytes to the Arduino board."""
    frame_bytes = frame.to_board_bytes()
    Bridge.call("draw", frame_bytes)
```

- **Code Generation**: The `AppFrame` class generates the C++ code displayed in the UI. It formats the internal array data into `uint32_t` hex values.

```python
# app_frame.py
def to_c_string(self) -> str:
    c_type = "uint32_t"
    parts = [f"const {c_type} {self.name}[] = {{"]
     # Converts pixel brightness data to uint32_t hex format
    parts.append("};")
    return "\n".join(parts)
```

### 🔧 Arduino Component (`sketch.ino`)

The sketch is designed to be a passive renderer, accepting commands from the Python backend.

- **Grayscale Setup**: The matrix is initialized with 8-bit grayscale support to allow for varying brightness levels.

```cpp
void setup() {
  matrix.begin();
  // configure grayscale bits to 3 so the display accepts 0..7 brightness
  // The backend sends quantized values in 0..(2^3-1) == 0..7.
  matrix.setGrayscaleBits(3);
  Bridge.begin();
  // ...
}
```

- **Drawing**: The `draw` provider accepts a vector of bytes and renders it directly.

```cpp
void draw(std::vector<uint8_t> frame) {
  matrix.draw(frame.data());
}
```

### 🔧 Frontend (`app.js`)

The JavaScript frontend handles the UI logic and data synchronization.

- **Auto-Persist**: To provide a responsive experience, changes are saved automatically after a short delay (debounce), updating both the database and the board simultaneously.

```javascript
// Unified persist: save to DB and update board together
function schedulePersist(){
  if (persistTimeout) clearTimeout(persistTimeout);
  persistTimeout = setTimeout(()=> {
    persistFrame();
    persistTimeout = null;
  }, AUTO_PERSIST_DELAY_MS);
}
```

## Limitations

Animation playback is subject to the following constraints:

- **Maximum frames**: Up to 10 frames per animation sequence
- **Maximum duration**: Total animation playback time must not exceed 10 seconds
